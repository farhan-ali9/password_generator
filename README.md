# password_generator


This program generates a random password based on the user's requirements for the number of letters, numbers, and symbols in the password.


To run the program, follow these steps:


1- Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer.



2- Save the code provided in a Python file with a .py extension (e.g., **password_generator.py**).



3- Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.



4- Run the Python file by typing python **password_generator.py** and pressing Enter.



5- The program will then prompt you for the following information:

How many letters you want in your password? - Enter the desired number of letters for your password.


How many numbers you want in your password? - Enter the desired number of numbers for your password.



How many symbols you want in your password? - Enter the desired number of symbols for your password.



After you have provided the input, the program will generate a random password that meets your criteria and display it on the screen.



Note: The program uses the random module in Python to make the password generation random. It defines three lists: alphabet (containing lowercase and uppercase letters), numbers, and symbols. The program then selects random characters from these lists and concatenates them to form the password.

Feel free to modify the code as per your requirements or integrate it into your projects. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out.
